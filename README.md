## Telegram Bots are Fun

These are just some simple bots I made to amuse my friends.
Feel free to use them for learning purposes (or add them to your groups to test how fun they can get).

The API wrapper used is [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) and you can find the documentation [here](https://python-telegram-bot.readthedocs.io/).
