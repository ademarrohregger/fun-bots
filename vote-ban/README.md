## Enables voting for bans.
Just add it to a chat and it will start adding users to a .db file when they're active.
When you want to vote for banning a user, use `/ban @username`.
The votes don't reset. When they reach a quorum, the user is removed from the group.
The bot needs administrator rights for this.
